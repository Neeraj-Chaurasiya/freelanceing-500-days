# üìÖ Day 21 ‚Äì SQL Views, Indexes & Stored Procedures

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Context
We continue working in the **SalesDB** database with tables:
- `customers` ‚Üí CustomerId, Name, City
- `sale` ‚Üí SaleId, Product, Category, Price, Quentity, CustomerId

Today focuses on **Views, Indexes, and Stored Procedures**.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Views

### Create a City-wise Revenue View
```sql
CREATE VIEW CityRevenues AS
SELECT c.City, SUM(s.Price * s.Quentity) AS TotalRevenue
FROM sale s
INNER JOIN customers c ON c.CustomerId = s.CustomerId
GROUP BY c.City;
```
- **CREATE VIEW** ‚Üí Creates a virtual table based on a query.  
- **INNER JOIN** ‚Üí Combines sale with customer data.  
- **GROUP BY c.City** ‚Üí Groups revenue per city.  
- **SUM(s.Price * s.Quentity)** ‚Üí Calculates total revenue.  
üëâ After this, `CityRevenues` can be queried like a table.

### Query the View
```sql
SELECT * FROM CityRevenues;
```
- Returns **city-wise total revenue** stored in the view.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Indexes

### Create Index on Customers.City
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_city ON Customers(City);
```
- **CREATE INDEX** ‚Üí Speeds up search/filtering.  
- Index on `City` column ‚Üí Faster queries filtering by city.

### Create Index on sale.Product
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_product ON sale(Product);
```
- Index on `Product` column ‚Üí Faster product search/aggregation.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Stored Procedures

### Drop old procedure (if exists)
```sql
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS GetTopProducts;
GO
```
- Ensures **no conflict** when creating new procedure.

### Create Procedure to Get Top N Products by Revenue
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetTopProducts 
    @TopN INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT TOP (@TopN) Product, SUM(Price * Quentity) AS TotalRevenue
    FROM sale
    GROUP BY Product
    ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;
END;
GO
```
- **CREATE PROCEDURE** ‚Üí Defines reusable SQL code.  
- `@TopN INT` ‚Üí Input parameter to control number of products.  
- **TOP (@TopN)** ‚Üí Returns only top N rows.  
- **GROUP BY Product** ‚Üí Aggregates revenue per product.  
- **ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC** ‚Üí Sort by revenue, highest first.  

### Execute the Procedure
```sql
EXEC GetTopProducts @TopN = 3;
```
- Runs the procedure with **TopN = 3**.  
- Returns **top 3 products by total revenue**.

## üìå Summary
- **Views** ‚Üí Virtual tables for reusable queries.  
- **Indexes** ‚Üí Speed up searches/aggregations on large tables.  
- **Stored Procedures** ‚Üí Encapsulate queries, reusable with parameters.  
- Use **DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS** to avoid errors.  
- Combining these features improves **query performance and code reusability**.
